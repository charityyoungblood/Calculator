    // Instead of creating a "storing" variable, we will create a "calculated" variable -- also known as a "Computed Property"
    // Instead of using = to set the variable, we place curly braces after the variable name and data type
    // Inside the curly brackets, place code to calculate the value when we "get" the value and when we "set" the value
